Setup instructions:

  * install Android Studio and get an emulator running.
  * npm install
  * if this fails, try again as administrator
  * if it fails again, don't worry, just go to node_modules/remote-redux-devtools and change the
    socketcluster-client dependency to 4.3.19
  * npm install (should work now)
  * react-native run-android
